# master_preprocessing
Preprocessing code for Master model project. It has the basic code to treat data and use it machine learning modeling.

It uses python and it is divided into 5 steps. 
- The first step separates the features and classes in variables.
- The next step encodes the necessary features.
- In this step, the outcome is encoded.
- In this step the data is splitted into training and test set.
- In this step the features is scaled to balance all the coefficients.
